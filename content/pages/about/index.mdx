Mae Govannen!  

I enjoy writing and creating new things. Thus, over the course of past few years, I ended up publishing a bunch of this-and-thats online such as:  

- [Substack based news letter (Korean)](https://duckduckhero.substack.com/) 
- [Normal Blog (Korean)](http://duckduckhero.tistory.com/)
- [Online Portfolio (Korean)](https://deokhaengportfolio.oopy.io/) 
- [Twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/duckduckhero) 
- ... and much more 

As you can see from above, my essays and memos were scattered all over different websites and platforms. I did not like this situation. Rather, I wanted to have ownership over a centralized thought-sharing venue where all my online creations will be compiled beautifully. That is why I opened this blog - upwind.  

Upwind is a concept that I first ran into while reading Paul Graham's [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html). 

> Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.
>  
> Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." Stay upwind.
