Mae Govannen!  

I enjoy writing and creating new things. Thus, over the course of past few years, I ended up making several different blogs/portfolio and a substack-based newsletter; my essays and memos were scattered all over different websites and platforms - I did not like this situation.  
Rather, I wanted to have ownership over a centralized thought-sharing venue where all my online creations will be compiled beautifully. That is why I opened this blog - upwind.  

Upwind is a concept that I first ran into while reading Paul Graham's [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html).
